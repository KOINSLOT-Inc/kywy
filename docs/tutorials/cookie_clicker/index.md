# Cookie Clicker Tutorial

_audience: beginner (middle school age and up)_

Learn programming fundamentals by building a fun Cookie Clicker game! This tutorial teaches you how to use variables, handle input, and create simple animations.

## What You'll Learn

- **Variables**: How to store and change information (like your cookie count)
- **Input Handling**: How to detect when buttons are pressed
- **Drawing**: How to put pictures and text on the screen
- **Animation**: How to make things move and change over time
- **Game Loops**: How games work behind the scenes

## What You'll Build

A simple Cookie Clicker game where:

- You press the RIGHT button to click a cookie
- Each click increases your cookie count
- The score is displayed at the top of the screen
- Cool animation circles appear when you click
- Instructions show at the bottom

## The Complete Code

Here's the full Cookie Clicker game code with detailed explanations:

```cpp title="examples/games/Clicker/Clicker.ino"
--8<-- "examples/games/Clicker/Clicker.ino"
```

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down each part of the code to understand how it works:

### 1. Setting Up Variables

```cpp
// Game variables - these store our game information
int cookieCount = 0;             // How many cookies we've clicked
bool showAnimation = false;      // Should we show the click animation?
int animationTime = 0;           // How long has the animation been running?
bool wasButtonPressed = false;   // Was the button pressed last time we checked?
```

**Variables** are like boxes that store information. Think of them as:

- `cookieCount` - A counter that remembers how many cookies you've clicked
- `showAnimation` - A yes/no answer about whether to show the circle animation
- `animationTime` - A timer that counts how long the animation has been running
- `wasButtonPressed` - Remembers if the button was pressed last time we checked

### 2. The Setup Function

```cpp
void setup() {
  engine.start();  // This starts up the Kywy engine
}
```

The `setup()` function runs **once** when your game starts. It's like turning on your game console - you only need to do it once.

### 3. The Game Loop

```cpp
void loop() {
  // This runs over and over again, many times per second
}
```

The `loop()` function runs **forever**, over and over again. This is called a "game loop" and it's how all games work. Each time through the loop, the game:

1. Checks for button presses
2. Updates the animation
3. Clears the screen
4. Draws everything new
5. Repeats!

### 4. Checking for Button Presses

```cpp
if (engine.input.buttonRightPressed && !wasButtonPressed) {
    cookieCount++;        // Add one more cookie
    showAnimation = true; // Start the click animation
    animationTime = 0;    // Reset animation timer
}
```

This code checks if the RIGHT button was **just pressed** (not held down). The `&&` means "AND" - both conditions must be true:

- Button is pressed now (`engine.input.buttonRightPressed`)
- Button was NOT pressed before (`!wasButtonPressed`)

This prevents the game from counting multiple clicks when you hold the button down.

### 5. Remembering Button State

```cpp
wasButtonPressed = engine.input.buttonRightPressed;
```

After we check the button, we remember its current state for next time. This is how we detect when it goes from "not pressed" to "pressed".

### 6. Animation Logic

```cpp
if (showAnimation) {
    animationTime++;
    if (animationTime > 30) {  // Stop animation after 30 loops
      showAnimation = false;
    }
}
```

This controls the circle animation:

- If animation is running, increase the timer
- After 30 loops (about half a second), stop the animation

### 7. Drawing Everything

```cpp
// Clear the screen
engine.display.clear();

// Draw the score
String scoreText = "Cookies: " + String(cookieCount);
engine.display.drawText(cookieX, 20, scoreText.c_str(),
  Display::TextOptions().origin(Display::Origin::Text::CENTER));

// Draw the cookie picture
engine.display.drawBitmap(/*...*/);

// Draw animation circles
if (showAnimation) {
    int circleSize = 70 + (animationTime * 2);
    engine.display.drawCircle(/*...*/);
}

// Show everything on screen
engine.display.update();
```

Drawing happens in steps:

1. **Clear** - Erase everything from last time
2. **Draw text** - Show the cookie count at the top
3. **Draw cookie** - Show the cookie picture in the center
4. **Draw animation** - If clicking, show expanding circles
5. **Update** - Actually display everything on the screen

## Try It Yourself!

### Step 1: Upload the Code

1. Open the Kywy development environment
2. Navigate to `examples/games/Clicker/`
3. Upload the code to your Kywy device
4. Press the RIGHT button to click cookies!

### Step 2: Experiment and Learn

Try making these changes to see how the code works:

#### Change the Animation Speed
```cpp
// Make animation faster (change 30 to 15)
if (animationTime > 15) {
    showAnimation = false;
}
```

#### Change How Many Cookies Per Click
```cpp
// Get 5 cookies per click instead of 1
cookieCount = cookieCount + 5;  // or cookieCount += 5;
```

#### Add Different Text
```cpp
// Change the score display
String scoreText = "Total Cookies: " + String(cookieCount) + " yum!";
```

#### Make Bigger Circles
```cpp
// Make the animation circles bigger
int circleSize = 100 + (animationTime * 3);  // Start at 100, grow by 3 each time
```

## Programming Concepts You've Learned

### Variables
You used different types of variables:
- `int` for numbers (like `cookieCount`)
- `bool` for true/false values (like `showAnimation`)

### Conditions (If Statements)
You used `if` statements to make decisions:
```cpp
if (something is true) {
    do this;
}
```

### Logical Operators
- `&&` means "AND" (both conditions must be true)
- `!` means "NOT" (opposite of true/false)

### Loops
The `loop()` function creates a game loop that runs forever.

### Functions
You used functions like `engine.display.clear()` to do specific tasks.

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the basics, you could try:

- Adding sound effects when clicking
- Creating different types of cookies worth different points
- Adding upgrades that increase points per click
- Creating a high score system
- Adding more animations and visual effects

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do we need `wasButtonPressed`?**
A: Without it, holding the button would count as hundreds of clicks per second! We only want to count when the button is first pressed.

**Q: What does `engine.display.update()` do?**
A: It's like pressing "save" - it takes everything you've drawn and actually shows it on the screen.

**Q: Why do we clear the screen each time?**
A: If we didn't clear it, old drawings would stay and create a mess. Clearing gives us a fresh start each frame.

**Q: How fast does the loop run?**
A: Very fast! Many times per second. That's why the animation looks smooth.

Congratulations! You've built your first game and learned fundamental programming concepts. Keep experimenting and have fun! üç™üéÆ
